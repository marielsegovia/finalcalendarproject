- have an admin account and password
- add a normal user to the system
- remove normal users from the system
- add and remove notes
- see tasks added to a specific date
- print the calendar

The code features user-friendly software that displays options for the user/admin, welcomes and thanks the user for using the software, and ciphers sensitive information.
